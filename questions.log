/*
    How the given data is associated:

       1. Boards have ids and names

       2. Lists belong to boards

       3. Cards belong to lists


	Each function that you write must take at least 2s to execute using the setTimeout function like so:

	function() {
		setTimeout(() => {
			// Your code here
		}, 2 * 1000);
	}
*/

/* 
	Problem 1: Write a function that will return a particular board's information based on the boardID that is passed from the given list of boards in boards.json and then pass control back to the code that called it by using a callback function.
*/

/* 
	Problem 2: Write a function that will return all lists that belong to a board based on the boardID that is passed to it from the given data in lists.json. Then pass control back to the code that called it by using a callback function.

    Get all the lists for the Thanos board
    Get all cards for the Mind list simultaneously

	Problem 5: Write a function that will use the previously written functions to get the following information. You do not need to pass control back to the code that called it.
